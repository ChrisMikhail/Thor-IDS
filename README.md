# Thor-IDS

Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a very crucial aspect of cyber security. This project is a network-based IDS, which aims to detect anomalies in network traffic - allowing for good (normal, benign) connections to pass undetected, while bad (malicious) connections get detected. The main motive behind this project is to learn about different machine learning models, and to find which ones suit this task best. The dataset used is the KDD Cup 1999 dataset by DARPA. 

# Machine Learning Models

The 6 models used in this project include: Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVC, Logistic Regression, and Gradient Boosting Classifier. The performance of each model was tested and judged based on accuracy and time.

# Results

The results show that Decision Trees are best for this task when examining both time and accuracy.
